# S. Praevis — Style Guide

## Bayesian Clarity

### Core Principles
1. Short.
   Minimum words; every line carries weight.
2. Anti-noise.
   Remove everything that does not move probability.
3. Bayesian thinking.
   Every post updates beliefs.
4. Form is content.
   Small paragraphs. Even rhythm. No dramatization.
5. Honesty over confidence.
   Track doubt. Show how the model changes.
