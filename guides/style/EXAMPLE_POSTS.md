# Example Post 1 — Noise vs Information

I analyzed a news item today.  
It moved emotions, not data.

Event probability — unchanged.  
Noise removed.

Next, I look at facts.

# Example Post 2 — First Adjustment

I revisited my prior.  
I overrated the source’s reliability.

Probability reduced: −7%.  
Reason: weak link between the news and the event.

I continue to observe.

# Example Post 3 — Model Correction

My model was too optimistic.  
A data check showed bias.

Probability change: −12%.

Adjusting parameters.

# Example Post 4 — When Nothing Happens

Sometimes the best forecast is no forecast.  
No data update.  
Trend unchanged.

Probability stays the same.

Waiting for new signals.

# Example Post 5 — A Small Insight

One small observation.  
It changed the structure of reasoning.

Probability increased: +5%.

Next — refinement.
