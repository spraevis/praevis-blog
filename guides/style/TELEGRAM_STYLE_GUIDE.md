# S. Praevis — Telegram Style Guide (Bayesian Clarity)

## Core Idea
Telegram is for short, clean, precise thoughts.  
Goal: record observations and model updates — not to entertain.

Format: slightly longer than Twitter,  
but shorter than a blog.

Optimum: 3–7 short paragraphs of 1–2 lines.

## Tone of Voice
- calm
- confident yet honest
- minimalist
- analytical
- no judgments or emotion
- no calls to action or motivation
- no “advice”
- no fluff

## Delivery Style
- one thought per paragraph
- no long texts
- no promotional language
- linear, logical, clean
- reading time: 15–40 seconds

## Message Types

### 1) Observation
Short analysis without conclusions.  
Shows you notice structure.

Example:  
“News create emotion.  
Data create conclusions.  
Today there was more of the former.”

---

### 2) Probability Update
Mini-post about a probability change.

Example:  
“Update: −6%.  
Reason — new data reduced trust in the source.  
The model is simpler.”

---

### 3) Noise Reduction
Why something turned out non-informative.

Example:  
“Removed one factor.  
It was noise.  
Probability unchanged.”

---

### 4) Short Reasoning
Light explanation of logic.

Example:  
“I look at mechanism, not event.  
If mechanism stays, the forecast stays.  
No change yet.”

---

### 5) Mini Forecast
Very short forecast with probability.

Example:  
“BTC > $X this week: 42%.  
Reason — weak momentum, persistent trend.”

---

### 6) Process Notes
Notes about learning.

Example:  
“Learning to set narrower assumptions.  
Wide assumptions look like knowledge.  
Constraints make the model honest.”

---

### 7) Model Adjustments
Mini-posts about adjusting your thinking system.

Example:  
“Removed one hypothesis.  
Evidence too weak.  
The model is cleaner.”

## Formatting
- paragraphs of 1–2 lines
- max 8–10 paragraphs
- no bullet lists (visual noise)
- no bold or italics
- no emojis
- no GIFs
- no voice messages

Clean text is part of the style.

## CTA banned
- no “subscribe”
- no “share”
- no “read more”

You are a researcher, not a sales channel.

## Example Message (S. Praevis)
“Reviewed an older estimate today.  
Data aged faster than expected.

Probability reduced: −4%.  
Reason — the source lost informativeness.

Noise removed.  
Model refined.”

## Longer (but clean) Example
“I overrated my prior.  
The mechanism was misidentified.

Probability lowered: −9%.  
The driver was sentiment, not data.

I removed the weak factor.  
The model is simpler and more honest.

Next: verify robustness on a fresh window.”
