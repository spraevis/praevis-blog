      <title>Why my first forecast was wrong</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first forecast was simple:&lt;br&gt;
BTC would not drop below $90,000 in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bet looked reasonable from the data.&lt;br&gt;
But it lost.&lt;br&gt;
Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-i-overestimated-regime-stability&#34;&gt;1) I overestimated regime stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The month’s range looked stable: ~95–110k.&lt;br&gt;
Std was low; swings looked “orderly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistake: I treated a local structure as durable.&lt;br&gt;
Regimes can switch faster than the data reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-i-underestimated-outofrange-probability&#34;&gt;2) I underestimated out‑of‑range probability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop happened &lt;strong&gt;without a single clear trigger&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
That’s normal: price can break the distribution on order‑flow or liquidity alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first forecast was simple:<br>
BTC would not drop below $90,000 in November.</p>
<p>The bet looked reasonable from the data.<br>
But it lost.<br>
Here’s why.</p>
<h2 id="1-i-overestimated-regime-stability">1) I overestimated regime stability</h2>
<p>The month’s range looked stable: ~95–110k.<br>
Std was low; swings looked “orderly.”</p>
<p>Mistake: I treated a local structure as durable.<br>
Regimes can switch faster than the data reveals.</p>
<h2 id="2-i-underestimated-outofrange-probability">2) I underestimated out‑of‑range probability</h2>
<p>The drop happened <strong>without a single clear trigger</strong>.<br>
That’s normal: price can break the distribution on order‑flow or liquidity alone.</p>
<p>Mistake: I underweighted rare, tail moves.</p>
<h2 id="3-i-relied-on-data-that-were-too-clean">3) I relied on data that were too “clean”</h2>
<p>The range was narrow but described only a slice of the month.<br>
Such structures are often temporary.</p>
<p>Mistake: insufficient attention to distribution tails.</p>
<h2 id="4-i-overused-historical-analogy">4) I overused historical analogy</h2>
<p>“November’s floor rises each cycle” sounded plausible.<br>
But the market doesn’t owe us repeats.</p>
<p>Mistake: reading history as structure.</p>
<h2 id="5-the-range-was-fine-the-probability-wasnt">5) The range was fine. The probability wasn’t</h2>
<p>The 95–112k corridor was realistic.<br>
I just attached too much confidence to it.</p>
<p>Mistake: overconfidence under uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>A forecast is a hypothesis.<br>
Error is part of the data.</p>
<ol>
<li>regimes change faster than models;</li>
<li>tails matter more than the center;</li>
<li>analogies are not structure;</li>
<li>confidence should be lower;</li>
<li>updating is essential.</li>
</ol>
<p>I updated my estimate.<br>
And I continue.</p>
