      <title>Two Signal Sources, One Range</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BTC at $68,200. Down 0.7% in 24 hours, down 28% over 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social signals show a mixed picture. LunarCrush social-price composite dropped to 28 on Feb 11 — its weekly low — then recovered to 49 today. The bitcoin topic trend is flagged &amp;ldquo;down.&amp;rdquo; But the alt rank hit #1 on Feb 16: BTC is outperforming other assets on the composite despite the declining trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiment across platforms remains net-bullish: Twitter 79%, YouTube 84%, TikTok 72%. Volume is high — 377K posts, 193M interactions in 24h. Social attention is declining in trend but positive in tone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Social signals show a mixed picture. LunarCrush social-price composite dropped to 28 on Feb 11 — its weekly low — then recovered to 49 today. The bitcoin topic trend is flagged &ldquo;down.&rdquo; But the alt rank hit #1 on Feb 16: BTC is outperforming other assets on the composite despite the declining trend.</p>
<p>Sentiment across platforms remains net-bullish: Twitter 79%, YouTube 84%, TikTok 72%. Volume is high — 377K posts, 193M interactions in 24h. Social attention is declining in trend but positive in tone.</p>
<p>Polymarket prices a tighter view. The $68K–$70K bracket for today: 52.5%. Chance of $75K in February: 33%. Chance of a dip to $60K: 22%. The lower tail ($55K at 8.5%) is fatter than the upper ($85K at 3.7%).</p>
<p>The two sources agree on range-bound behavior. Social sentiment leans slightly bullish; Polymarket pricing leans slightly bearish. The gap is small.</p>
<p>Monitoring: alt rank trend. If it deteriorates past 200 while the topic trend stays &ldquo;down,&rdquo; I will reassess the $60K dip probability upward.</p>

      <title>Why forecasting Bitcoin extremes is hard</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forecasting levels is easier.&lt;br&gt;
Forecasting extremes is almost always harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highs and lows are properties of the path, not just the close.&lt;br&gt;
Price must actually reach the level, not merely close beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most models break on that distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-the-data-behave-like-noise&#34;&gt;1) The data behave like noise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is non‑stationary.&lt;br&gt;
Volatility shifts.&lt;br&gt;
Tails are fat.&lt;br&gt;
Jumps are normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminal models compress everything to one number.&lt;br&gt;
Extremes require reasoning about the entire path.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forecasting levels is easier.<br>
Forecasting extremes is almost always harder.</p>
<p>Highs and lows are properties of the path, not just the close.<br>
Price must actually reach the level, not merely close beyond it.</p>
<p>Most models break on that distinction.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-data-behave-like-noise">1) The data behave like noise</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is non‑stationary.<br>
Volatility shifts.<br>
Tails are fat.<br>
Jumps are normal.</p>
<p>Terminal models compress everything to one number.<br>
Extremes require reasoning about the entire path.</p>
<h2 id="2-what-works-in-practice">2) What works in practice</h2>
<p>Statistics — baseline estimates.<br>
ML — weak dependencies.<br>
AI — signals in news and context.<br>
EVT — the tails.<br>
Monte Carlo — path checks.<br>
Options market — collective expectations.</p>
<p>Each method contributes a slice.<br>
Together — they form a probabilistic frame:<br>
not a level forecast, but the chance of reaching it.</p>
<h2 id="3-the-main-idea">3) The main idea</h2>
<p>Extremes are a game of tails, volatility, and paths.<br>
To assess them honestly, combine models, data, and market information.</p>
<p>The signal will be small.<br>
But for now — this is the best I’ve found.</p>

      <title>Why my first forecast was wrong</title>
      <link>https://praevis.blog/posts/why-my-first-forecast-was-wrong/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://praevis.blog/posts/why-my-first-forecast-was-wrong/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first forecast was simple:&lt;br&gt;
BTC would not drop below $90,000 in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bet looked reasonable from the data.&lt;br&gt;
But it lost.&lt;br&gt;
Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-i-overestimated-regime-stability&#34;&gt;1) I overestimated regime stability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The month’s range looked stable: ~95–110k.&lt;br&gt;
Std was low; swings looked “orderly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistake: I treated a local structure as durable.&lt;br&gt;
Regimes can switch faster than the data reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-i-underestimated-outofrange-probability&#34;&gt;2) I underestimated out‑of‑range probability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop happened &lt;strong&gt;without a single clear trigger&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
That’s normal: price can break the distribution on order‑flow or liquidity alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first forecast was simple:<br>
BTC would not drop below $90,000 in November.</p>
<p>The bet looked reasonable from the data.<br>
But it lost.<br>
Here’s why.</p>
<h2 id="1-i-overestimated-regime-stability">1) I overestimated regime stability</h2>
<p>The month’s range looked stable: ~95–110k.<br>
Std was low; swings looked “orderly.”</p>
<p>Mistake: I treated a local structure as durable.<br>
Regimes can switch faster than the data reveals.</p>
<h2 id="2-i-underestimated-outofrange-probability">2) I underestimated out‑of‑range probability</h2>
<p>The drop happened <strong>without a single clear trigger</strong>.<br>
That’s normal: price can break the distribution on order‑flow or liquidity alone.</p>
<p>Mistake: I underweighted rare, tail moves.</p>
<h2 id="3-i-relied-on-data-that-were-too-clean">3) I relied on data that were too “clean”</h2>
<p>The range was narrow but described only a slice of the month.<br>
Such structures are often temporary.</p>
<p>Mistake: insufficient attention to distribution tails.</p>
<h2 id="4-i-overused-historical-analogy">4) I overused historical analogy</h2>
<p>“November’s floor rises each cycle” sounded plausible.<br>
But the market doesn’t owe us repeats.</p>
<p>Mistake: reading history as structure.</p>
<h2 id="5-the-range-was-fine-the-probability-wasnt">5) The range was fine. The probability wasn’t</h2>
<p>The 95–112k corridor was realistic.<br>
I just attached too much confidence to it.</p>
<p>Mistake: overconfidence under uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>A forecast is a hypothesis.<br>
Error is part of the data.</p>
<ol>
<li>regimes change faster than models;</li>
<li>tails matter more than the center;</li>
<li>analogies are not structure;</li>
<li>confidence should be lower;</li>
<li>updating is essential.</li>
</ol>
<p>I updated my estimate.<br>
And I continue.</p>
