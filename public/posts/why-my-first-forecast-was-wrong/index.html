<meta name="description" content="My first forecast was simple:
BTC would not drop below $90,000 in November.
The bet looked reasonable from the data.
But it lost.
Here’s why.
1) I overestimated regime stability
The month’s range looked stable: ~95–110k.
Std was low; swings looked “orderly.”
Mistake: I treated a local structure as durable.
Regimes can switch faster than the data reveals.
2) I underestimated out‑of‑range probability
The drop happened without a single clear trigger.
That’s normal: price can break the distribution on order‑flow or liquidity alone.">
