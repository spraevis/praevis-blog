I’m starting to study forecasting to think more precisely.  
Most forecasts are confident words without probabilities.  
I care less about asserting and more about testing.

Here I will log the learning process:  
how my estimates change,  
what turns out to be noise,  
and how the model is corrected.

First steps are simple: observe, assign probabilities,  
remove unnecessary assumptions.  
The model will change — and that’s part of the process.

This blog is not about being right.  
It’s about honesty under uncertainty.

— S. Praevis
