Any forecast consists of five steps.  
It sounds simple. In practice — it’s discipline.

**1. Problem definition.**  
Not “what to predict?”, but how it will be used.  
For prediction markets: which event, what horizon, what success criterion.

**2. Information gathering.**  
Two sources: data and context.  
Sometimes the data are scarce — then understanding the mechanism matters more.

**3. Preliminary analysis.**  
Plots, trends, jumps, seasonality, outliers.  
You need to see the structure before you build a model.

**4. Model selection and fitting.**  
Simple or complex — depends on the data and the goal.  
Compare options and understand their assumptions.

**5. Use and evaluation.**  
A forecast is a hypothesis.  
Only the future shows how honest the model was.  
Errors are part of the process: measure them and update the model.

This is especially clear on Polymarket: the quality of a forecast is the quality of the process.
