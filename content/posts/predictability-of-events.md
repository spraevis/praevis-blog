On prediction markets the key is to judge how predictable the event itself is.
There are four conditions that determine this.

1. **Understanding the drivers.**
If the structure of the event is clear, you can assign a probability.
If the factors are fuzzy, forecasting turns into guessing.

2. **Availability of data.**
The more data and repeatable patterns, the better.
If data is scarce, the market becomes a psychological game.

3. **Similarity of the future to the past.**
Typical events are predictable.
Unique events are almost not.

4. **Impact of the forecast on the outcome.**
Some markets are self-influencing:
expectations change reality.

For Polymarket this matters a lot:
sometimes the market predicts the event,
and sometimes the event is shaped by the market.
