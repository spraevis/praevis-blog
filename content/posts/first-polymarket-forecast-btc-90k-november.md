Update (2025-11-20): Outcome Yes (touched $90k). My position No lost. See post‑mortem: {{< relref "/posts/why-my-first-forecast-was-wrong.md" >}}.

This is my first public forecast and my first stake on Polymarket.  
Market question: **“Will Bitcoin dip to $90,000 in November?”**  
I bought **No** at ~65%.

Below is how I arrived at the estimate.

## 1. History of BTC in November

I compiled stats across all Novembers.  
Key figures:

- November average: **≈ $34k**
- standard deviation: **≈ $32k**
- minimum: **≈ $3.8k**
- maximum: **≈ $110.5k**

Conclusion: November is one of the most volatile months for BTC.  
But the structure of volatility depends on the cycle.

## 2. Cycle dynamics (2017–2021)

- 2018: strong capitulation after the 2017 peak  
- 2020–2021: recovery and a new high  
- November 2021: all values in the month > $53k  
- the November “floor” and “ceiling” rise together with the cycle

## 3. What November 2025 shows

In 2025 data:

- November mean: **≈ $103k**
- std: **≈ $4.4k**
- min: **$94.6k**
- max: **$110.5k**

This is a new regime.  
The November 2025 minimum is already above the November maximum of the previous cycle.

The market has effectively moved into the **~100k** range, where ±4–9k swings fit the month’s usual structure.

## 4. Range forecast

Based on the mean (103k) and 2σ (±8.7k):

**Expected corridor of the final November close:**  
**$95,000 – $112,000**  
Center: ~103k.

For BTC to reach **$90,000**, the market would need to:

- break 2σ down,  
- set a new monthly low,  
- exit the current price regime.

That’s an event‑driven risk, not a statistical scenario.

## 5. My position

I took **No** at 65% probability.  
Reasons:

- the month’s current structure is above 95k  
- historical patterns support a higher floor  
- volatility is sufficient, but not to 90k without an external shock  
- 90k sits in the lower 3σ zone (unlikely without event triggers)

Final phrasing:

> **Probability BTC does NOT touch $90,000 in November: ~70–75%.**

## 6. What I want to validate

This is the first test of my methodology:

- data → structure → ranges → probability → stake  
- subsequent calibration on the realized outcome  
- compute Brier score

This process is the backbone of my forecasting approach.
