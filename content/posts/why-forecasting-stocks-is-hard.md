Forecasting works where the data have structure.  
Stocks have weak structure.

⸻

1. Weak patterns

Trends break on news.  
Seasonality is minimal.  
Cycles are unstable.  
Autocorrelations are low.

The data behave like noise.

⸻

2. The main drivers are outside the time series

Future prices depend on what is not in the history:  
regulator decisions, earnings, liquidity, events, market sentiment.

The time series does not contain causes.

⸻

3. Predictors are unknown or unpredictable

It’s not enough to know the variables — you must forecast them.  
With stocks, that’s hard or impossible.

⸻

4. Regimes change abruptly

Low rates → tightening → crisis → recovery.  
Each regime invalidates the last one’s conclusions.

⸻

5. The forecast changes the market

Expectations become part of price.  
Any pattern disappears when it’s exploited.

⸻

6. Noise dominates

Large outliers.  
News jumps.  
Local, short‑lived regularities.

Signal is weak; noise is strong.

⸻

Conclusion

Stocks violate the key conditions for predictability:  
- no stable structure,  
- no robust drivers,  
- no repeatability,  
- no stationarity,  
- and the forecast feeds back into the object.

Therefore, forecasting stocks is one of the hardest problems.  
Uncertainty exceeds information.
