My first forecast was simple:  
BTC would not drop below $90,000 in November.

The bet looked reasonable from the data.  
But it lost.  
Here’s why.

## 1) I overestimated regime stability  
The month’s range looked stable: ~95–110k.  
Std was low; swings looked “orderly.”

Mistake: I treated a local structure as durable.  
Regimes can switch faster than the data reveals.

## 2) I underestimated out‑of‑range probability  
The drop happened **without a single clear trigger**.  
That’s normal: price can break the distribution on order‑flow or liquidity alone.

Mistake: I underweighted rare, tail moves.

## 3) I relied on data that were too “clean”  
The range was narrow but described only a slice of the month.  
Such structures are often temporary.

Mistake: insufficient attention to distribution tails.

## 4) I overused historical analogy  
“November’s floor rises each cycle” sounded plausible.  
But the market doesn’t owe us repeats.

Mistake: reading history as structure.

## 5) The range was fine. The probability wasn’t  
The 95–112k corridor was realistic.  
I just attached too much confidence to it.

Mistake: overconfidence under uncertainty.

## Takeaways  
A forecast is a hypothesis.  
Error is part of the data.

1) regimes change faster than models;  
2) tails matter more than the center;  
3) analogies are not structure;  
4) confidence should be lower;  
5) updating is essential.

I updated my estimate.  
And I continue.
