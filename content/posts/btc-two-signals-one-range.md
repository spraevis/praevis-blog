BTC at $68,200. Down 0.7% in 24 hours, down 28% over 30 days.

Social signals show a mixed picture. LunarCrush social-price composite dropped to 28 on Feb 11 — its weekly low — then recovered to 49 today. The bitcoin topic trend is flagged "down." But the alt rank hit #1 on Feb 16: BTC is outperforming other assets on the composite despite the declining trend.

Sentiment across platforms remains net-bullish: Twitter 79%, YouTube 84%, TikTok 72%. Volume is high — 377K posts, 193M interactions in 24h. Social attention is declining in trend but positive in tone.

Polymarket prices a tighter view. The $68K–$70K bracket for today: 52.5%. Chance of $75K in February: 33%. Chance of a dip to $60K: 22%. The lower tail ($55K at 8.5%) is fatter than the upper ($85K at 3.7%).

The two sources agree on range-bound behavior. Social sentiment leans slightly bullish; Polymarket pricing leans slightly bearish. The gap is small.

Monitoring: alt rank trend. If it deteriorates past 200 while the topic trend stays "down," I will reassess the $60K dip probability upward.
